Hi, I make stuff. I am very much learning what I'm doing along the way, so please bear with me! I have a tendency to reinvent the wheel, you may come to learn.

I wouldn't consider anything I make production-ready, but the word "production" could really mean anything, anyway, I guess, so that's at your discretion. I provide no warranty for anything I make at all.

Just wanted to give a quick heads up that a lot of my stuff requires my own packages. I modularize even my own stuff to reuse as much code as possible without copy and paste. I'm probably in the process of doing that if you haven't seen me push in a while. This is exactly why you shouldn't use my stuff. I refactor too often. Right?
